## Setup (works as of now, working on better solution)

1. Copy this file into your WP install

2. In `cloneWpPosts()`, replace `[your-site]` with the site who's posts you wish to duplicate

3. Call `cloneWpPosts()` in your `functions.php`

4. Refresh your page once, then remove `cloneWpPosts()` function call

5. All posts and featured media images should now be in your site
